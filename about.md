Hi!

My name is Silas Hoevers and I am a master's student in the Netherlands. I have a wide range of interests and I intend to boil down the things I have learned into insightful and useful posts here.

For now, here's a list of stuff that I made:

- [Discourse on Discord: An analysis of relations between users (Bachelor Thesis)](https://purl.utwente.nl/essays/94778)
- [SBOM Generator Scorecard (Master Thesis)](https://purl.utwente.nl/essays/108745)
