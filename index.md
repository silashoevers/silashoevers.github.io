Howdy

If you're searching for a bass that stands out both visually and sonically, meet the **Emerald Thunder** â€“ a custom-built short scale bass that blends vintage soul with modern power.

This striking **green beauty** sports a sleek **Bass VI body**, giving it a retro silhouette with a comfortable, ergonomic feel. But don't let the classic curves fool you â€“ under the hood, this machine is built for tone versatility and punch.

Outfitted with **two growling humbuckers**, the Emerald Thunder delivers everything from warm, vintage thump to aggressive, modern edge. Whether you're laying down mellow grooves or driving a fuzzed-out riff, this bass has the tonal range to follow your creative lead.

Switch seamlessly between pickups with the **pickup selector**, giving you fast control on stage or in the studio. You can dial in deep low-end with the neck pickup, cut through the mix with the bridge, or blend both for a thick, dynamic tone.

The **short scale** design (30") makes it incredibly playable â€“ perfect for players with smaller hands, guitarists doubling on bass, or anyone who loves the snappy attack and smooth feel that only a short scale can provide.

With **4 strings**, it keeps things classic and straightforward. No frills, just tone and playability where it counts.
